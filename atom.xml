                <p><em>Plasmid makes it easy</em> to take advantage of storage browsers provide for our
web applications today.</p>

<p><em>Building offline first web apps is a breeze</em> with Plasmid.js, the javascript
library that makes the complicated details of IndexedDB under the hood and makes
it easy to build, utilize, and manage your browser-side databases.</p>

<p>But, <em>users don't live on one device</em> and the web thrives online. That's why
Plasmid was built from the ground up to support synroncizing these databases
with the Plasmid Sync server.</p>

<p>Together, Plasmid.js and Plasmid Sync make building amazing, data-rich
web applications effortless. The pair are ideal for building web apps and web-based
installed applications. You can target all major platforms and users can enjoy
their data at their fingertips wherever they are.</p>

<p>Plasmid is a <i>VERY EARLY</i> project. Today, it functions, but is lacking in a lot
of crucial functions, unit tests, and stability. Please try Plasmid and give
feedback, but don't rely on it just yet!</p>
